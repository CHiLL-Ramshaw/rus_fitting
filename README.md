# rus_fitting
- Code to fit the full elastic tensor to a resonant ultrasound spectroscopy resonance spectrum.
- The code consists of forward solvers and fitting classes. We have implemented three forward solvers (RPR, SMI, Comsol) and three fitting classes (ray, lmfit, scipy_leastsq).
- A typical workflow for a fit looks as follows:
    - initialize a forward solver (or "rus_object")
    - pass the rus_object to the fitting class

More details on all forward solvers and fitting classes are given below:
